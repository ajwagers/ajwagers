Projects in this GitHub

[Word Analysis](https://github.com/ajwagers/WordAnalysis) -- Looking at books on Project Gutenberg and running a lot of analysis on them including a Word Cloud, Character Sentiment Analysis, and more.

[Dadbot](https://github.com/ajwagers/chatbot_0.0) -- I have a couple rough attempts at building a chatbot using AI.  The first version was a chatbot that tells Dad Jokes but would work as a FAQ chatbot.

[RecipeHunter](https://github.com/ajwagers/reciptehunter) -- I have used Spoonacular's API to search for ingredients based on what you want to include and what ingredients you want to avoid.  I hope to automate this for different diets and allergies as well as tie into the FDAs nutrition API to estimate nutritional value.

[Gravity Run](https://github.com/ajwagers/GravityRun) -- This is my entry for the Space Force Association Game Jam from March 2024.  You play as a rocket but you can only move up and down, you must use the gravity of passing objects to move left and right.  Collect space probes and score points but watch out for the black hole!

[Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/ajwagers/sudoku-solver) -- I am working on a sudoku solver that uses simulated annealing to find the solution.  This is a work-in-progress.

[textreset.sh](https://github.com/ajwagers/textreset.sh) -- This is a bash script I wrote for my [PinePhone](https://pine64.com/product-category/pinephone/) to clear out the MMS cache which, if full, would keep regular SMS messages from getting through.

[House Hunting Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ajwagers/HouseHuntNotebook) -- I used CSV files downloaded from Redfin.com to optimize my house search through a Jupyter Notebook.

[Quiz Buzzer](https://github.com/ajwagers/QuizBuzzer) -- This is an Arduino Nano project I built to help my kids and our National Bible Bee group practice their quiz questions.  

[Galactic Altitude Calculator](https://github.com/ajwagers/Galactic-Altitude-Calculator) -- This was a javascript page I wrote in grad school to find the altitude along the meridian of the Milky Way Galactic Equator in the sky given a time and location on the earth.
