Projects in this GitHub

[Dadbot](https://github.com/ajwagers/chatbot_0.0) -- I have a couple rough attempts at building a chatbot using AI.  The first version was a chatbot that tells Dad Jokes but would work as a FAQ chatbot.

[textreset.sh](https://github.com/ajwagers/textreset.sh) -- This is a bash script I wrote for my [PinePhone](https://pine64.com/product-category/pinephone/) to clear out the MMS cache which, if full, would keep regular SMS messages from getting through.

[House Hunting Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ajwagers/HouseHuntNotebook) -- I used CSV files downloaded from Redfin.com to optimize my house search through a Jupyter Notebook.

[Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/ajwagers/sudoku-solver) -- I am working on a sudoku solver that uses simulated annealing to find the solution.  This is a work-in-progress.

[Quiz Buzzer](https://github.com/ajwagers/QuizBuzzer) -- This is an Arduino Nano project I built to help my kids and our National Bible Bee group practice their quiz questions.  

[Galactic Altitude Calculator](https://github.com/ajwagers/Galactic-Altitude-Calculator) -- This was a javascript page I wrote in grad school to find the altitude along the meridian of the Milky Way Galactic Equator in the sky given a time and location on the earth.
