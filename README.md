Projects in this GitHub

[textreset.sh](https://github.com/ajwagers/textreset.sh) -- This is a bash script I wrote for my [PinePhone](https://pine64.com/product-category/pinephone/) to clear out the MMS cache which, if full, would keep regular SMS messages from getting through.

[House Hunting Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ajwagers/HouseHuntNotebook) -- I used CSV files downloaded from Redfin.com to optimize my house search through a Jupyter Notebook.

[Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/ajwagers/sudoku-solver) -- I am working on a sudoku solver that uses simulated annealing to find the solution.  This is a work-in-progress.
