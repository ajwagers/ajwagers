👋 Hi, I’m Andy (@ajwagers, Andy J. Wagers, Ph.D.)
📊 I am a Senior Data Analyst & Operations Research Expert
🔭 Combining a Ph.D. in Physics with 4+ years of mission-critical data leadership for the United States Space Force, 🚀
💻 I architect scalable data solutions that transform complex information into actionable insights. 
📝 From designing real-time analytics platforms supporting space launch operations to leading data science hackathons that produce operational MVPs, 
🌉 I bridge the gap between advanced analytics and practical business impact.
🔄 My expertise spans the full data lifecycle—from architecting cloud-native pipelines with Snowflake and AWS to developing optimization algorithms that compress five-day scheduling processes into five minutes. ⏳
🛫 Whether it's building predictive maintenance models for aircraft logistics or mentoring cross-functional teams on data-driven decision making, 
📟 I thrive at the intersection of rigorous scientific methodology and innovative technology solutions.
🏖 Based in the Space Coast of Florida, I'm passionate about leveraging data to solve complex operational challenges and drive organizational transformation through intelligent automation and strategic analytics.
